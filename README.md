Turn drag on for gravity, the hot early universe did not have planets, slow the sim down to see gravity!!

# Ultimate Ideal Gas Simulation - VC funded project

## üî¨ What's this?

Welcome to an advanced particle physics playground! This simulation lets you explore how thousands of particles behave under different physical forces - from basic collisions to complex phenomena like temperature equilibrium, gravity wells, and even a mini universe.

**Probably For**: STEM students, educators, curious coders, kids fascinated by physics, and anyone who wants to see invisible forces in action!

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Hit Reset** to seed fresh particles
2. **Open the Pipe** to connect the two boxes
3. **Watch the magic** - hot (red) particles mix with cold (blue) ones
4. **Check the graphs** to see temperature equilibrium happen in real-time!

## üé® Visual Guide

### Particle Colors (Speed-Based)

- **üîµ Blue**: Slow/cold particles (low kinetic energy)
- **üü¢ Green**: Medium speed particles
- **üü° Yellow**: Fast particles
- **üî¥ Red**: Very fast/hot particles (high kinetic energy)

The simulation uses HSL color shifting, so you'll see smooth transitions through the entire spectrum as particle speeds change!

another nice picture sprinkled in, try to use the settings you see to get the same, hopefully it should work, if not open the config values and spend hours tweaking the constants and magic numbers :D

## üéõÔ∏è Control Panel Guide

### Basic Controls

**Total Particles** (100 - 120,000)

- More particles = more realistic physics but slower performance
- Sweet spot: 10,000 for most experiments
- Use Grid mode for 10,000+ particles with gravity/pressure

**Left/Right Temperature** (0 - 30,000)

- Sets initial particle speeds in each box
- Only affects new particles when you Reset
- Try extreme differences (50 vs 30,000) for dramatic effects!

**Particle Radius** (1-12px)

- Bigger particles = more collisions
- Large radius + few particles = easy to follow individual bounces
- Small radius + many particles = realistic gas behavior

**Pipe Height** (0-100%)

- Controls the opening between boxes
- 0% = completely sealed
- 100% = wide open connection
- Try 1-5% for realistic gas flow effects

### Advanced Physics

**Maxwell's Demon** üëπ

- When ON: Only allows fast particles to move left‚Üíright
- Demonstrates the famous thermodynamics thought experiment
- **Creates density gradients**: Fast particles accumulate on the right, slow on the left
- **Demon Threshold**: Sets how fast a particle needs to be (1-250)
  - Higher = demon is pickier about "fast" particles
  - Lower = demon lets more particles through

**Collision Modes**

- **SAP Mode**: More accurate physics, better for studying collisions
- **Grid Mode**: Faster performance, creates cool 3D-like effects with large particles

**Force Systems**

- **Gravity**: Particles attract each other (creates clusters/singularities)
- **Pressure**: Particles repel nearby neighbors (realistic gas pressure)
- **Friction**: Energy loss during collisions (particles slow down over time)
- **Drag**: Air resistance effect (fast particles lose more speed)

### Performance Tuning

**Substeps** (1-8)

- Higher = more accurate collision detection
- Lower = better performance
- Reduce if simulation feels laggy

**Max Speed** (5-2500)

- Speed limiter to prevent particles from going too fast
- Lower values = calmer simulation

**Uncap FPS** üöÄ

- Progressively increases simulation speed: 60‚Üí80‚Üí100‚Üí120+ FPS
- Watch temperature equilibrium happen in seconds instead of minutes!
- May stress your CPU - use with caution

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Simulation running slowly?**

- Reduce particle count or switch to Grid mode
- Turn off Gravity and Pressure for 10,000+ particles
- Lower Substeps to 1-2

**Simulation frozen or hanging?**

- **Reset all settings to defaults** - sometimes extreme combinations cause issues
- Hit Reset button to clear corrupted particle states
- Reload the page if completely stuck

**Particles behaving weirdly?**

- Hit Reset to clear any accumulated errors
- Check if Max Speed is too low
- Make sure Pipe Height isn't at 0% when you want mixing

**Graphs not updating?**

- They update automatically - wait a few seconds
- Hit Reset to clear old data

**Maxwell's Demon not working?**

- Make sure there's actually a speed difference between sides
- Adjust Demon Threshold - try values between 10-100
- The demon works even with pipes closed!

## üåü Advanced Notes

This simulation uses optimized algorithms to handle thousands of particles in real-time:

- **Spatial partitioning** for efficient collision detection
- **WebGL rendering** when available (falls back to 2D canvas)
- **Adaptive physics stepping** for smooth performance
- **Force approximation** for gravity/pressure calculations

The physics engine separates collision detection (SAP vs Grid) from force calculations, allowing you to mix and match for different effects and performance characteristics.

**Have fun exploring the invisible world of particle physics! üöÄ**

## üéØ Push the Limits!

**Don't be afraid to break things!** This simulation is built to handle extreme conditions:

- Crank particles to 120,000 and see what happens
- Turn on ALL forces at once and watch chaos unfold
- Set ridiculous temperatures (30,000 vs 0) and observe the mayhem
- Find the breaking point of your device - where does it start to lag?
- Discover weird edge cases and unexpected behaviors
- **You are only limited by your imagination!**

The best way to learn physics is to push systems beyond their normal operating ranges. Go wild, experiment, and see what fascinating phenomena emerge from the complex interactions of simple rules.
